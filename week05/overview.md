# Week 5: Loops

## Overview

Welcome to Week 5! Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times - essential for processing collections of data, automating repetitive tasks, and building powerful programs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences
- Use `while` loops for conditional repetition
- Understand when to use each type of loop
- Use `range()` to generate sequences
- Control loop flow with `break` and `continue`
- Nest loops within loops
- Combine loops with functions

## Topics Covered

1. **For Loops**
   - Iterating over lists, strings, ranges
   - Loop variables
   - `range()` function
   - Looping with indices using `enumerate()`

2. **While Loops**
   - Condition-based looping
   - Avoiding infinite loops
   - Common while loop patterns
   - User input loops

3. **Loop Control**
   - `break` - Exit loop early
   - `continue` - Skip to next iteration
   - `else` clause with loops

4. **Nested Loops**
   - Loops within loops
   - Processing multi-dimensional data
   - Performance considerations

5. **Practical Applications**
   - Processing data collections
   - Accumulating values
   - Finding items
   - Validating input

## Assignments This Week

```{note}
All assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the specified date in Canvas
```

- **Exercise 4** - Loop the Loop (assigned this week)
- **Exercise 3** - Due this week
- **Weekly Discussion** - Participate in forum

## Readings

**Required:**
- Mastrodomenico, R. (2022) - Chapter 11 (Loops)
- Review course materials on loops

**Recommended:**
- [Python For Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)
- [Python While Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)
- [Real Python - For Loops](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/)

## Key Concepts

```{important}
**Loops automate repetition.** Instead of writing the same code 100 times, write it once in a loop that runs 100 times.
```

### For vs While

**Use FOR when:**
- You know how many times to loop
- You're iterating over a collection
- You're using a counter/range

**Use WHILE when:**
- Looping until a condition is met
- You don't know how many iterations needed
- Getting user input until valid

## What You'll Build

This week you'll create programs that:
- Process lists of data
- Calculate totals and averages
- Find maximum/minimum values
- Validate user input repeatedly
- Generate patterns and sequences

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Single loops before nested ones
2. **Test small** - Use small datasets while learning
3. **Watch for infinite loops** - Make sure while conditions can become False
4. **Use descriptive loop variables** - Not just `i`, but `student`, `item`, etc.
5. **Print debug info** - See what's happening each iteration
