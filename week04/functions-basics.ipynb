When we are talking about functions in computer programming in Python, we want to consider what we can reuse in our code and what is useful to us. We can define our own modules that are nothing but definitions of functions we've created. This is **extremely** useful in that it means we don't have to *reinvent the wheel* (as they say) every time we want to do something similar. Consider that the functions built into the Python core are just the same; they are sets of code that we can reuse over and over.
