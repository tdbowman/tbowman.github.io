# Introduction to Programming in Python

**Course: LIS 440 / LIS 805**  
**Instructor: Dr. Timothy D. Bowman**

## Welcome!

Welcome to Introduction to Programming in Python! This online textbook has been created specifically for students with little to no programming experience. Whether you're an undergraduate or graduate student, this resource will guide you through the fundamentals of Python programming **culminating in an exciting robotics simulation capstone project!**

```{admonition} New: Block-Based Learning Structure!
:class: tip

This course is organized into **4 thematic blocks** instead of isolated weekly topics. Each block builds on the previous one, creating a clear learning narrative from foundations to real-world applications—including a **robotics simulation capstone** where you build a virtual robot!
```

## 📚 Course Structure: 4 Blocks

### [Block 1: Computational Thinking & Foundations](block01/overview.md)
**Weeks 1-4 | Core Question:** *How do we tell computers to think?*

Learn programming fundamentals: variables, functions, control flow, and how to think like a programmer.

**Topics:** Variables • Data types • Strings • Functions • Conditionals

### [Block 2: Data Structures & Computation](block02/overview.md)
**Weeks 5-7 | Core Question:** *How do programs manage and interpret information?*

Work with real data using Python's powerful data structures and learn to process information at scale.

**Topics:** Loops • Lists • Tuples • Dictionaries • **Midterm Exam**

### [Block 3: Systems, APIs, AI & Object Thinking](block03/overview.md)
**Weeks 8-11 | Core Question:** *How do programs interact with other systems?*

Connect to external systems, work with databases and APIs, and understand object-oriented programming.

**Topics:** Modules • Files • APIs • JSON • Databases • OOP

### [Block 4: Python + Robotics (Capstone)](block04/overview.md) 🤖
**Weeks 12-14 | Core Question:** *How do software systems perceive, decide, and act?*

Build a virtual robot that navigates, makes decisions, and accomplishes tasks—**no physical hardware required!**

**Topics:** OOP design • **Robotics simulation** • Autonomous navigation • Capstone project
