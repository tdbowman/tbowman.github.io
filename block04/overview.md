# Block 4: Python + Robotics (No Hardware Capstone)

**Duration:** Weeks 12-14 (Late November - December)  
**Core Question:** *How do software systems perceive, decide, and act?*

---

## 🤖 Block Themes

This block brings everything together in an exciting capstone: **building a virtual robot that thinks and acts using Python.**

You'll apply OOP, loops, conditionals, data structures, and algorithms to create an autonomous agent that navigates a simulated environment, makes decisions, and accomplishes tasks—all without any physical hardware!

### What is "Robotics Without Hardware"?

**Robotics** = sensing + decision-making + action

You don't need motors and circuits to learn robotics concepts. Professional roboticists use simulation for:
- **Prototyping** - Test ideas before building hardware
- **Safety** - Simulate dangerous scenarios
- **Scale** - Run thousands of robots in parallel
- **Accessibility** - No equipment costs

**Your virtual robot will:**
- Navigate a grid-based world
- Sense obstacles and goals
- Make decisions based on data
- Execute actions and log behavior
- Demonstrate real robotics concepts

        self.y = y
        self.direction = "north"
    
    def move_forward(self):
        # Move logic
        pass
    
    def sense_obstacle(self):
        # Check for obstacles
        pass
```
