# Week 2: Syntax & Variables

## Overview

Welcome to Week 2! This week builds on what you learned in Week 1 by diving deeper into Python syntax and exploring the different data types available in Python. You'll learn how Python interprets your code and how to work with numbers, text, and logical values.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand Python's indentation rules and why they matter
- Identify and use the four basic data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Check the type of any variable using the `type()` function
- Perform mathematical operations with proper order of operations
- Use comparison operators to make decisions
- Concatenate strings and convert between data types
- Write conditional statements using if/elif/else
- Debug common syntax and type errors

## Topics Covered

1. **Python Syntax Fundamentals**
   - Indentation rules
   - Code blocks
   - Common syntax errors and how to fix them

2. **Data Types**
   - Integers (int)
   - Floating-point numbers (float)
   - Strings (str)
   - Booleans (bool)
   - Type checking and conversion

3. **Mathematical Operations**
   - Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
   - Order of operations (PEMDAS)
   - Working with mixed data types

4. **String Manipulation**
   - String concatenation
   - Combining strings with other types
   - Common string errors

5. **Conditional Logic**
   - if/elif/else statements
   - Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
   - Logical flow control

## Assignments This Week

```{note}
All assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the specified date in Canvas
```

- **Exercise 2** - Variable data types and operations (assigned this week)
- **Intro Video** - Due this week (from Week 1)
- **Exercise 1** - Due this week (from Week 1)
- **Weekly Discussion** - Participate in the discussion forum

## Readings

**Required:**
- Speight, A. (2020) - Chapters 5-7
-- Parker, J. R. (2021) - Chapter 1
  
**Supplemental:**
- [Python Data Types - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)
- [Python Operators - Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions/)
- [A Quick Tour of Python Language Syntax](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/02-basic-python-syntax.html)

## Key Concepts

```{important}
**Python is a dynamically-typed language** - This means you don't have to declare what type of data a variable holds. Python figures it out automatically! This is different from languages like Java or C++.
```

### Why Data Types Matter

When you design applications, you often expect certain types of data from users or other sources (databases, files, etc.). Understanding data types helps you:

- Prevent errors in your programs
- Perform the right operations on your data
- Convert data between formats when needed
- Debug issues more effectively

## What's Different This Week?

Week 1 introduced you to variables and basic naming. This week you'll learn:

- **HOW** Python interprets your code (syntax rules)
- **WHAT** kinds of data you can store (data types)
- **WHY** mixing data types can cause errors
- **WHEN** to convert between types

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice with the interactive notebooks** - Run every code example yourself
2. **Experiment with errors** - Try breaking the code to understand error messages
3. **Use type()** frequently - Check what type your variables are
4. **Comment your code** - Explain what each section does
5. **Ask questions** - If you're confused, post in the discussion forum!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```{warning}
**Watch out for these common errors:**
- Forgetting to indent code blocks
- Mixing up `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)
- Trying to concatenate strings with numbers directly
- Case sensitivity: `myVar` ≠ `myvar` ≠ `MyVar`
```

## What's Next?

After completing Week 2, you'll be ready for Week 3 where we'll explore:
- More advanced variable operations
- User input and output
- String methods and formatting
- Working with multiple variables
