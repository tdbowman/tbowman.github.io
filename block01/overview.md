# Block 1: Computational Thinking & Python Foundations

**Duration:** Weeks 1-4 (August - September)  
**Core Question:** *How do we tell computers to think?*

---

## 🎯 Block Themes

This block introduces you to programming as a way of solving problems. You'll learn to break down complex tasks into logical steps and express them in Python code.

Programming isn't about memorizing syntax—it's about developing a new way of thinking. By the end of this block, you'll think like a programmer: breaking problems into steps, designing solutions, and expressing them in code.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Core Competencies
- **Think procedurally and algorithmically** - Break problems into steps
- **Write Python programs from scratch** - Express ideas in code
- **Use variables, functions, and control flow** - Build program logic
- **Debug and test your code** - Find and fix errors
- **Build a foundation** - Everything that follows builds on this

### Technical Skills
✅ Variables and data types  
✅ Operators and expressions  
✅ String manipulation and formatting  
✅ User input and validation  
✅ Conditional statements  
✅ Functions and parameters  
✅ Code organization and style

## 📅 Weekly Topics

### [Week 1: Course Introduction & Programming Basics](../week01/overview.md)
- What is programming?
- Setting up your environment (Anaconda, Jupyter)
- Variables and naming conventions
- Your first Python programs

**Key Concept:** Programming is communication with computers

### [Week 2: Syntax & Variables](../week02/overview.md)
- Python syntax rules and indentation
- Data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
- Mathematical and comparison operators
- Type conversion and conditionals

**Key Concept:** Python has rules, just like human languages

### [Week 3: Variables & Data Types (Advanced)](../week03/overview.md)
- String methods and manipulation
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Input validation and conversion
- F-strings and formatting
- String slicing and escape characters

**Key Concept:** All input is strings—you must convert it

### [Week 4: Functions](../week04/overview.md)
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Function documentation (docstrings)
- Variable scope (local vs global)
- Code organization and the DRY principle

**Key Concept:** Functions let you reuse code and think modularly

  - Apply what you've learned to real data
  - Practice functions, loops, and data structures
  - Build a complete program from scratch

### Reflection
- **Personal Reflection #1** - What does it mean to "think like a programmer"?

---

## 🎯 Skills You'll Lock In

By the end of Block 1, you will be able to:

### Procedural Thinking
- Break complex problems into smaller steps
- Design algorithms before writing code
- Think about edge cases and error handling

### Debugging Mindset
- Read and understand error messages
- Systematically test your code
- Use print statements to debug
- Fix syntax and logic errors

### Translation Skills
- Convert problems → logic → code
- Express ideas in Python syntax
- Organize code for readability
- Document your work clearly

---

## 🌟 Why This Block Matters

**Block 1 is your foundation.** Everything in Blocks 2-4 builds on these concepts:

- **Block 2** uses functions to process data structures
- **Block 3** uses functions to integrate with systems
- **Block 4** uses functions to control virtual robots

If you master Block 1, the rest of the course becomes much easier!

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Week by Week Strategy

**Week 1:** Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing syntax  
**Week 2:** Practice daily—even 15 minutes helps  
**Week 3:** Start thinking in functions—every problem is a function  
**Week 4:** Review Weeks 1-3 to see how everything connects  

### Study Habits
1. **Type all code yourself** - Don't copy-paste
2. **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens
3. **Ask questions early** - Don't wait until you're stuck
4. **Form study groups** - Explain concepts to each other
5. **Complete exercises** - They give instant feedback

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Skipping exercises (you need the practice!)  
❌ Not reading error messages (they tell you what's wrong!)  
❌ Trying to memorize everything (focus on understanding)  
❌ Giving up when stuck (debugging is part of learning)  
❌ Working alone (programming is collaborative)
