# Week 8: Modules

## Overview

Welcome to Week 8! Modules let you organize code into reusable files and access Python's vast standard library. You'll learn to import existing modules and create your own.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand what modules are and why they're useful
- Import and use Python's standard library modules
- Use different import syntax (import, from...import, as)
- Create your own modules
- Organize code across multiple files
- Use the `dir()` and `help()` functions
- Understand module search paths

## Topics Covered

1. **Module Basics**
   - What are modules?
   - Why use modules?
   - The import statement

2. **Standard Library Modules**
   - `math` - Mathematical functions
   - `random` - Random number generation
   - `datetime` - Date and time handling
   - `os` - Operating system interface
   - `sys` - System-specific parameters

3. **Import Variations**
   - `import module`
   - `from module import function`
   - `import module as alias`
   - `from module import *` (avoid!)

4. **Creating Your Own Modules**
   - Writing a module file
   - Using your modules
   - `if __name__ == "__main__":`
   - Module best practices

5. **Packages**
   - What are packages?
   - Package structure
   - `__init__.py` files

## Assignments This Week

```{note}
All assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the specified date in Canvas
```

- **Assignment 2** - Assigned this week
- **Exercise 5** - Due this week (from Week 7)
- **Weekly Discussion** - Participate in forum

## Readings

**Required:**
- Review course materials on modules
- "Byte of Python" - Modules chapter

**Recommended:**
- [Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)

## Key Concepts

```{important}
**Modules are Python files.** Any `.py` file can be imported as a module. This lets you organize large programs into manageable pieces.
```

### Why Modules Matter

- **Code Reuse** - Write once, use everywhere
- **Organization** - Break large programs into files
- **Namespaces** - Avoid name conflicts
- **Standard Library** - Access thousands of pre-built functions
- **Third-party Packages** - Use code from the community
