## 💡 Tips for Success

### Development Strategy
1. **Start with basics** - Get a simple robot moving first
2. **Test incrementally** - Don't write everything at once
3. **Commit often** - Use Git to save versions
4. **Document as you go** - Don't leave it to the end
5. **Ask for help** - Use office hours and forums

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Trying to implement everything at once  
❌ Not testing edge cases  
❌ Waiting until the last day  
❌ Forgetting to document  
❌ Not handling errors  
❌ Making code too complex  

### Success Patterns
✅ Break project into small tasks  
✅ Test each component separately  
✅ Start simple, add features gradually  
✅ Get feedback early  
✅ Use print statements to debug  
✅ Keep code organized and clean
