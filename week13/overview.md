# Week 13: Robotics Simulation

## Overview

Welcome to Week 13! This is where everything comes together. You'll apply all your Python skills to build and control a virtual robot—no hardware required!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Design and implement a virtual robot using OOP
- Create a grid-based simulation environment
- Implement robot sensors (distance, obstacle detection)
- Program decision-making algorithms
- Use the sense-think-act control loop
- Navigate a robot from start to goal
- Log and analyze robot behavior
- Debug autonomous systems

## Topics Covered

1. **Robotics Fundamentals**
   - What is robotics? (Sensing + Deciding + Acting)
   - Why simulation matters
   - Real-world applications

2. **Virtual Environment**
   - Grid-based worlds
   - Coordinates and positions
   - Obstacles and goals
   - Visualization

3. **Robot Design (OOP)**
   - Robot class structure
   - State (position, direction, status)
   - Methods (move, turn, sense)
   - Inheritance for different robot types

4. **Sensors**
   - Virtual distance sensors
   - Obstacle detection
   - Goal detection
   - Sensor data processing

5. **Decision-Making**
   - Sense-think-act loop
   - Conditional logic for navigation
   - Path planning basics
   - Handling stuck situations

6. **Control Systems**
   - Autonomous behavior
   - Manual vs automatic control
   - Event-driven programming
   - Error handling

## Assignments This Week

```{note}
This week focuses on building the foundation for your final capstone project
```

- **No formal assignment** - Focus on learning robotics concepts
- **Prepare for Week 14** - Start planning your capstone robot
- **Experiment** - Try different robot behaviors
- **Weekly Discussion** - Share robot ideas

## Key Concepts

```{important}
**Robotics = Sensing + Deciding + Acting**

This is the core loop:
1. **Sense** - Get information about the environment
2. **Decide** - Process data and choose action
3. **Act** - Execute the action
4. **Repeat** - Loop continuously
```
