This variable is **different** from a variable named 'Foo' or a variable named 'FoO'.  This is very important for you to remember. You should always name variables appropriately according to the function the variable is serving. In addition, you should always be consistent in your naming format; for instance, if you have a variable named 'firstName', then you are using camelCase to name the variable and you should remain consistent throughout your code by naming other variables using camelCase. If you start with 'first_name', then use underscores throughout your code.  Just be consistent!"
