# Course Introduction

## Welcome to Programming in Python!

As you settle into the course, please understand that regular and effective communication between you and me is essential to your success. I look forward to being your professor and teaching you about Programming in Python.

## Course Philosophy

```{important}
I do reserve the right to change the syllabus if/when there is a point in the semester where I'm moving forward and you, as a majority, aren't with me.
```

If I feel like a majority of you haven't mastered some portion of the material, I may not move forward with the normal lecture. Instead, I may revisit the previous week to ensure you are where you need to be. 

**I will not move forward just to cover everything on the syllabus if the majority of students don't understand an important concept.** This isn't fair to you—you are here to learn how to program, not to cover a certain number of topics on the syllabus.

## Course Format

This is a **hybrid course** which means:

- **Online components** - Video lectures, readings, exercises
- **In-person meetings** - Four face-to-face sessions (or Zoom)
  - Meeting times: Saturdays 10:30 AM - 1:30 PM
  - Location: Main Campus, Crown Library, Crown 302

All course materials will be available in our Canvas site:

#### Graduate Students

```{note}
Graduate work will be graded more strictly and requires demonstrating depth and breadth of programming knowledge commensurate with graduate-level coursework.
```

| Grade | Points | Range |
|-------|--------|-------|
| A+, A | 4.00 | 95-100 |
| A- | 3.67 | 90-94 |

## Expectations

### For Participation (8%)

To meet participation expectations:

- **View all class lectures on time** - Each lesson builds on previous knowledge
- **Complete readings before class** - Come prepared to discuss
- **Engage in discussions** - Contribute meaningfully to weekly forums
- **Ask questions** - Don't wait until you're lost

### For Written Assignments

- Writing should be appropriate to the task and grammatically correct
- If writing is difficult for you, seek help from the Writing Lab
- Proofread your work or have a trusted friend review it

## Different Expectations for Undergraduate vs. Graduate Students

1. **Midterm Exam**
   - Undergraduates: Traditional questions + 1 programming question
   - Graduates: Traditional questions + 2 programming questions (more in-depth)

2. **Programming Assignments**
   - Both groups complete the same assignments
   - Graduates are graded more strictly
   - Graduates must demonstrate advanced programming techniques

3. **Programming Exercises**
   - Both groups complete identical exercises
   - These build foundational skills needed to advance

4. **Class Participation**
   - Both groups have discussion weeks and participation points

## Important Reminders

```{warning}
**Academic Integrity**: All work must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged for learning, but submitted work must reflect your individual understanding and effort.
```

If you ever have questions or concerns about grades, **please ask!** I welcome questions about grades as opportunities to think critically about the work we do.
