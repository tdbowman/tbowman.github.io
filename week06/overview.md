# Week 6: Lists & Tuples

## Overview

Welcome to Week 6! Lists and tuples are fundamental data structures in Python. They let you store collections of data and work with them efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create and manipulate lists
- Use list methods (append, insert, remove, pop, etc.)
- Slice lists to extract portions
- Sort and reverse lists
- Understand when lists are mutable
- Create and use tuples
- Understand when to use tuples vs lists
- Combine lists/tuples with loops
- Use list comprehensions (introduction)

## Topics Covered

1. **Lists Fundamentals**
   - Creating lists
   - Accessing elements (indexing)
   - Slicing lists
   - List mutability

2. **List Methods**
   - Adding: `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`
   - Removing: `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`
   - Organizing: `sort()`, `reverse()`
   - Finding: `index()`, `count()`

3. **Working with Lists**
   - Looping through lists
   - List comprehensions
   - Nested lists
   - Copying lists (shallow vs deep)

4. **Tuples**
   - Creating tuples
   - Tuple immutability
   - Tuple unpacking
   - When to use tuples vs lists

5. **Practical Applications**
   - Storing related data
   - Processing collections
   - Managing ordered data
   - Returning multiple values from functions

## Assignments This Week

```{note}
All assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the specified date in Canvas
```

- **Exercise 4** - Due this week
- **Weekly Discussion** - Participate in forum

## Readings

**Required:**
- Mastrodomenico, R. (2022) - Chapters 7 & 8 (Lists and Tuples)
- Review course materials

**Recommended:**
- [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
- [Python Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)
- [Real Python - Lists and Tuples](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)

## Key Concepts

```{important}
**Lists are mutable** (can be changed).  
**Tuples are immutable** (cannot be changed).  

Use lists when you need to modify data.  
Use tuples when data shouldn't change.
```

### Lists vs Tuples

**Lists:**
- Mutable - can add, remove, change items
- Square brackets: `[1, 2, 3]`
- More memory, slightly slower
- Use for collections that change

**Tuples:**
- Immutable - cannot change after creation
- Parentheses: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Less memory, slightly faster
- Use for fixed data, function returns, dictionary keys

## What You'll Build

This week you'll create programs that:
- Manage shopping lists
- Process student grades
- Organize data collections
- Track inventory
- Analyze sequences

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice indexing** - Remember it starts at 0!
2. **Try methods** - Experiment with each list method
3. **Use loops** - Lists and loops work great together
4. **Understand mutability** - Know when changes affect original
5. **Choose wisely** - Pick lists or tuples based on needs
